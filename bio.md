<h2>Programming Background</h2>
My interest in programming began at home learning BASIC,  decades ago, then in highschool c++ and Visual Basic, and in college c,  but obviously I went on to pursue a degree in another field.
I later went on to learn some Iphone/Android programming during spare time, learning the concepts of OOP along the way, and decided to begin studying it again. 
Over this last break I learned Python and used it to solve about 60 of the Euler Project problems.  It was a great way to learn a new language and keep my problem solving skills sharp between terms.  There are a lot of features of Python I really enjoy and found it very fast to develop in.
