My name is Brandon Swanson,  I am very much enjoying the Ecampus program so far.  I live in the bay area Califorina and am looking forward to it being warm enough to go surfing again.

<h2>Programming Background</h2>
My interest in programming began at home learning BASIC,  decades ago, then in highschool c++ and Visual Basic, and in college c,  but obviously I went on to pursue a degree in another field.
I later went on to learn some Iphone/Android programming during spare time, learning the concepts of OOP along the way, and decided to begin studying it again.
