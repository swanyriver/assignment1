My name is Brandon Swanson and I am 30 years old
I am very much enjoying the Ecampus program so far.  I live in the bay area Califorina and am looking forward to it being warm enough to go surfing again.


<h2>Programming Background</h2>
My interest in programming began at home learning BASIC,  decades ago, then in highschool c++ and Visual Basic, and in college c,  but obviously I went on to pursue a degree in another field.
I later went on to learn some Iphone/Android programming during spare time, learning the concepts of OOP along the way, and decided to begin studying it again.
One of my proudest acomplishments in this program was an NCURSES implementation of Game-Of-Life that was made through subclassing the abstract classes of the previous terminal character output version.
Over this last break I learned Python and used it to solve about 60 of the Euler Project problems.  It was a great way to learn a new language and keep my problem solving skills sharp between terms.  There are a lot of features of Python I really enjoy and found it very fast to develop in.
